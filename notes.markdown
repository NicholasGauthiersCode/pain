###Welcome to my notes!

Down below you will find a bunch of links that will lead you to their respective area. The top most link is the most general (math, physics, engineering, programming) and as you dig in you will find more specified links (Newtonian Physics, Python, Engineering Mechanics).

This part of my website takes heavy inspiration from places like [Mat3ma][https://www.math3ma.com/], [Vsauce][https://www.youtube.com/c/vsauce1], [3Blue1Brown][https://www.3blue1brown.com/], and all of the other channels I have watched over the years. To me, being able to share knowledge and information is one of the most important things I believe anyone can do and this is my avenue for being able to do that.

I hope that my notes are useful to whoever uses them and are able to spark an interest in what I do for anyone else!
