This is a run down of angular momentum, more information on rotating bodies can be found in [[Rotations]] dealing with more than angular momentum.

### Linear and Rotational Motion
Translational (linear) motion is analogous to angular motion. Because of this the conservation of momentum is analogous to the conservation of angular momentum, which is the rotational version of linear momentum. For more information in linear Momentum check [[Collisions]]

##### Quantities in Translational Motion
$m$ - Mass
$v$ - Velocity
$p = mv$ - Linear Momentum
$\frac12 mv^2$ - Linear Kinetic Energy

##### Quantities in Rotational Motion
$I$ - Moment of Inertia
$\omega$ - Angular Velocity
$L = I\omega$ - Angular Momentum
$\frac12 I\omega ^2$ - Rotational Kinetic Energy

##### Conservation of Angular Momentum
Since linear and rotational motion are analogous we can say that since

$$\Large m_iv_i = m_fv_f$$
- Conservation of Momentum

then

$$\Large I_i\omega_i = I_f\omega_f$$
- Conservation of Angular Momentum

### Inertia
The inertia of a rotating object can be found through the equation

$$\Large I = mr^2$$

Where the radius from the center to the object and the mass make up the inertia

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

$$\Large L_{before} = L_{after}$$

where

$$\Large L = I\omega$$

So if I, inertia, decreases because of the radius becoming smaller, then %omega;, angular velocity, will become faster in order to keep the system in equilibrium.

### Dropping Mass in a Rotating Object
If you drop a mass on a rotating object

and you want to see if the angular momentum is conserved you can use the equation:

$$\Large L_{Board,\,Before} + L_{Mass,\,Before} = L_{Board+Mass,\,After}$$

Which this equation is eerily similar to a perfectly inelastic collision, which more information can be found in [[Collisions#Types of Collisions]].

### Parallel Axis Theorem
The parallel axis theorem is used when an object is rotating around an axis that is NOT the center of mass and you want to find the intertia. The equation to use for the parallel axis theorem is:

$$\Large I = I_{cm} + m\cdot d^2$$

Key
I = inertia
I<sub>cm</sub> = Inertia of the object using the center of mass as the reference point
m = mass of the object
d = distance the new axis of rotation is from the center of mass

More information can be found in [[Torque#Parallel Axis Theorem]]

### Equations
$$p = mv$$
- momentum equation

$$v = r\omega$$
- converting from angular velocity to linear velocity

$$L = rp$$
- converting linear momentum into angular momentum

$$I = mr^2$$
- inertia equation

$$L = I\omega$$
- angular momentum equation
