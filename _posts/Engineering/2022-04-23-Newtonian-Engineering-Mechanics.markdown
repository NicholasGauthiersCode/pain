<h3>Engineering Mechanics, Newtonian</h3>
Welcome to engineering mechanics dealing with newtonian physics? What does that mean? Well to start off with, newtonian mechnics is the most 'basic' physics there is. It deals with real world physical phenomena that most everyone has delt with at some point. This class deals with newtonian physics but with more in the lens of engineering. There are some really interesting topics and I hope you'll check out some of it!
