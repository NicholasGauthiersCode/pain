<h4>Working Date, May 2022 - June 2022</h4>

It has been a bit since I finished this project, mainly because I put it on the
back burner a bit (thanks calculus 3 in the summer!) and because I actually wanted
to do a bit more with it. The grand scheme was to make a "sentry turret" (a fancy
way of saying throwing a nerf gun on top of the camera) and there were a few
set backs to that.
