<h4>Working Date, May 2022 - June 2022</h4>

It has been a bit since I finished this project, mainly because I put it on the
back burner a bit (thanks calculus 3 in the summer!) and because I actually wanted
to do a bit more with it. The grand scheme was to make a "sentry turret" (a fancy
way of saying throwing a nerf gun on top of the camera) and there were a few
set backs to that.

To start off with, lets look at the first draft of my idea.

When I was thinking of a "face tracking camera" this is what I imagined in my mind instantly.
A servo, a stepper motor, all connected to an arduino board to make the whole thing work.

Since this was all I had, it's what I went with.

<h4>What this project taught me</h4>
This project comprised a 3 main parts
1. Designing and 3D printing the stand and mount for the camera
2. Wiring everything together
3. Programming the whole shabang.

In order to explain this project, I am going to go through the main 3 parts and explain them in a but more detail.

<h3>Step 1. Designing and Printing a Mount.</h3>
