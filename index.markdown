<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

Here is a place that I will be able to put some of the intersting things that I am doing and... for more information about myself and this website checkout my <a href='https://nickgauth.github.io/pain/about/'>About Me</a> page! if you want to checkout what I am learning in school as an engineer, check out my <a href='https://nickgauth.github.io/pain/notes/'>Notes</a> or even my <a href='https://nickgauth.github.io/pain/projects'>Projects</a>!

I have made a few webisites in the past already a few on Wix because they are surprisingly easy to make, 2 with pure HTML (and they looked exactly as you would expect them to), and one more with WordPress. I used to host those two HTML pages and wordpress site on Oracle's free servers, but, they ended up deleting them after it turns out you need to log in at least once every two months. I didn't do it and now they are gone. But, every sad story has it rising moment and this website is exactly that. It is a culmination of all that I have learned so far about web design, which is realtivly little. I am still a freshman in college and learning all of this new and interesting stuff is just a side project/passion for me.

This specfic website is hosted using GitHub's GitHub pages server hosting. I am very glad I learned about it because it is really a fun project I think everyone should do. It's not as boring as dragging and dropping text boxes like Wix or WordPress and you learn a lot of things you would never expect to. For this project alone I have had to touch base with HTML and CSS since I haven't worked with them in a couple months when I started and I had to familiarize myself with the Git framwork that GitHub uses and Ruby, which is the backbone of this website.

Overall I am very happy with how things are coming and I hope that this is an enjoyable place to look and browse through!
